## Description

The Family Tree App is a React application that displays a family tree structure. It allows users to click on person boxes to view their detailed information.

## Features

* **Interactive Family Tree:** Visual representation of a family tree with clickable person boxes.
* **Detailed Information:** Displays date of birth, date of death (if applicable), and address for each person.
* **Visual Cues:** Highlights the selected person box for easy identification.
* **Vercel Analytics:** Implements Vercel Analytics for tracking user interactions.

## Prerequisites

* Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed.

## Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository (if applicable):**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd <your-repository-directory>
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Start the Development Server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    This will launch the application in your default web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

* **View the Family Tree:** The application displays a visual representation of the family tree upon loading.
* **Click on a Person Box:** Click on any person box (e.g., "Brother 1", "Wife 2") to view their detailed information.
* **View Details:** The selected person's information (date of birth, date of death, address) will be displayed within the box.
* **Highlighting:** The clicked person box will be highlighted to indicate the active selection.
* **Vercel Analytics:** User interactions are automatically tracked using Vercel Analytics.

## File Structure

* `src/App.js`: Contains the main React component for the application.
* `src/App.css`: Contains the CSS styles for the application.
* `src/index.js`: Entry point of the React application.
* `src/index.css`: Global CSS styles.
* `src/logo.svg`: Placeholder image files for the person boxes. Replace these with actual images.
* `public/index.html`: Main HTML file.

## Image Replacement

* Replace the placeholder image files (`src/logo.svg`) with your own images for each person in the family tree.
* Ensure that the image file paths in `App.js` are updated accordingly.

## Customization

* **Styling:** Modify `src/App.css` to customize the appearance of the family tree.
* **Data:** Update the person information (date of birth, date of death, address) in `App.js` to reflect your actual family tree data.
* **Structure:** Modify the HTML structure in `App.js` to represent your desired family tree layout.
* **Add/Remove People:** Add or remove person boxes and adjust the layout as needed.

## Vercel Analytics

* This application uses Vercel Analytics to track user interactions.
* Ensure that you have set up Vercel Analytics for your project.

## Deployment

* Deploy the application to a hosting platform of your choice (e.g., Vercel, Netlify).
* Follow the deployment instructions provided by your hosting platform.

## Notes

* This application is a basic example and can be extended to include more features and functionalities.
* Consider using a data structure (e.g., JSON) to store and manage the family tree data for larger and more complex family trees.
* For a better user experience, implement responsive design to ensure the application works well on different screen sizes.
